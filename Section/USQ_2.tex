\subsection{A Quality Framework} \label{usq_2}
In this section we introduce the quality framework which use traditional requirement known as the Software Product Certification Model (SPCM)\cite{heck2010software} to establish quality criteria for agile requirements. SPCM is based on extensive literature research for traditional up-front requirements engineering. 

In order to certification two types of input are required: (1) one or more software artifacts and (2) on or more properties of these artefacts that are to be certified. The SPCM divides a software artifact into six Product Areas, namely the \emph{Context Description}, which describes the environment of the system, the \emph{User Requirement}, the \emph{High-Level Design}, the \emph{Detailed Design}, the \emph{Implementation} and \emph{Test}. Next to the division, the SPCM defines specific certification criteria for each area \cite{heck2010software}. The properties of these artifacts which Heck et al. have denoted as \enquote{Conformance Properties}, can fall into one of the following categories:

\begin{itemize}
\item Consistency: do the different (parts of) software artifacts conform to each other?
\item Functional: does input to the system produce the expected output?
\item Behavioral: does the system meet general safety and progress properties like absence of deadlocks or are constraints on the speciﬁc states of the system met?
\item Quality: do the artifacts fulﬁll nonfunctional requirements in the areas of for example performance, security, and usability?
\item	Compliance: do the artifacts conform to standards, guidelines, or legislation?

\end{itemize}

Based on the SPCM they define three overall criteria for agile requirements \cite{heck2014quality}: 
\textbf{Completeness}\\ 
All elements of the agile requirement should be present. Three levels have considered: \emph{basic} elements, \emph{required} elements, \emph{optional }elements. In that way it can differentiate between elements that are absolutely mandatory for a requirement and elements that are nice to have because they increase the requirement quality. \\ 
\textbf{Uniformity}\\ 
The style and format of the agile requirements should be standardized, because this leads to less time for understanding and managing the requirements. Each time a team member is confronted with a new requirement he/she needs some time to understand the requirement and decide what to do with it. This process takes less time when the requirements format is standardized. Then all team members know where to look for what information on the requirement or how to read certain models attached to the requirement. \\ 
\textbf{Conformance}\\ 
Each element in the requirements is described in a correct and consistent way. The relations between the elements in the requirements description and with the context description are correct and consistent. They should be subject to manual verification, as: two requirements or use cases contradict each other; No requirement is ambiguous; Functional requirements specify what, not how; Each requirement is testable; Each requirement is uniquely identiﬁed; Each requirement is atomic; The glossary deﬁnitions are non-cyclic; Use case diagrams correspond to use case text; The data model diagram is in normal form.

The following criteria are explicitly delineated for USs, as depicted in figure \ref{fig:arvf}:

\begin{itemize}
\item Basic Elements: Role, activity, business value (‘Who needs what why?’) instead of summary and description
\item Required Elements: acceptance criteria or acceptance tests to verify the story instead of rationale
\item Optional Elements: the team could agree to more detailed attachments to certain user stories (e.g. UML models) for higher quality
\item Stories Uniform: each user story follows the standard user voice form
\item Attachments Uniform: any modeling language used in the attachments is uniform and standardized
\end{itemize}

In this scholarly paper, we expound upon an extensive assortment of techniques and tools that traverse diverse domains. These domains encompass agile software development, with a distinct emphasis on backlog management for the acknowledgment of user stories and their associated quality criteria. Furthermore, we delve into the realm of natural language processing (NLP) and its intricate interplay with computational lexicon resources, which is pivotal for tasks related to natural language comprehension. Additionally, we explore techniques of extracting domain models from textual requirements, which are instrumental in applying graph transformation rules and in discerning conflicts and dependencies among user stories.

The principal objective of our scholarly pursuit is to conduct a comparative analysis of these techniques and tools within each domain. Our intention is to harness this analysis for future endeavors, aiming to establish a meticulously structured workflow. This framework holds the promise of expediting the automated detection of conflicts and dependencies inherent within user stories expressed in natural language.

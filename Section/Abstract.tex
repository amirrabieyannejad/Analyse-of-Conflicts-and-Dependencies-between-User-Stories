In this scientific work we explain an extensive selection of techniques and tools that cover different areas. These domains include agile software development with a particular focus on backlog management to recognize user stories and the associated quality criteria. In addition, we address the area of natural language processing (NLP) and its complex interplay with computational lexicon resources, which is crucial for tasks related to natural language understanding. In addition, we explore techniques for extracting domain models from textual requirements, which are crucial in applying graph transformation rules and detecting conflicts and dependencies between user stories.

The main objective of our scientific activity is to carry out a comparative analysis of these techniques and tools in each field. Our goal is to make this analysis usable for future ventures and to establish a carefully structured workflow. This framework promises to accelerate the automatic detection of conflicts and dependencies contained in natural language user stories.
